listening to lofi
listening to "a very silly playlist that will tickle your brain" (I should probably download it in case it gets removed from youtube for some reason)
interest in doing the actual thing I try to focus at

listening to songs with lyrics (most of the time it absolutely doesn't work)
listening to linkin park instrumentals (they're just too damn good to not pay attention to 😭)
people talking in the background (sometimes my brain manages to cut them off but it's unreliable)
