listening to lofi
listening to "a very silly playlist that will tickle your brain" (I should probably download it in case it gets removed from youtube for some reason)

listening to songs with lyrics
listening to linkin park instrumentals (they're just too damn good to not pay attention to ðŸ˜­)
people talking in the background (sometimes my brain manages to cut them off but it's unreliable)
